# 12 Agile Principles 
 1. **Customer satisfaction** – Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
    
2. **Welcome change** – Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
    
3. **Frequent delivery** – Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.
    
4. **Collaboration** – Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
    
5. **Motivated individuals** – Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
    
6. **Face-to-face conversation** – The most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face conversation.
    
7. **Working software** – Working software is the primary measure of progress.
    
8. **Sustainable pace** – Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
    
9. **Technical excellence** – Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
    
10. **Simplicity** – Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
    
11. **Self-organizing teams** – The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
    
12. **Reflection & improvement** – At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
